Kindness in your eyes 
I guess you here me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child

I blessed I know 
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child

And what have I learned
From all this pain
I thought I'd never feel the same
About anyone
Or anything again
But now I know
When you find your love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
